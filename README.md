Tagebuch - Front-End

This is the Front-End part of the Tagebuch, here I've build the UI.

Also as functionality I added the options to: register, login. This is key concept, because if user does not register or login he will not be able to neither read nor create, update or delete notebooks.

As a validation tool I use specific React library that can assign the cookies and check whether they are "alive" or not.
